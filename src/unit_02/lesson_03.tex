\lesson{Alkenes and Alkynes}
\subsection{Alkenes}
A subgroup of hydrocarbons that contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds.
\begin{enum}
    \item For alkenes, the parent chain is identified by selecting the longest carbon chain that
        contains both C atoms of the carbon-carbon double bond
    \item Then, select the appropriate prefix to indicate the total number of carbon atoms in the
        parent chain and use the suffix ``-ene'' to indicate the presence of a double bond
\end{enum}

\subsection{Alkynes}
A subgroup of hydrocarbons that contain one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds.
\begin{enum}
    \item For alkenes, the parent chain is identified by selecting the longest carbon chain that
        contains both C atoms of the carbon-carbon triple bond
    \item Then, select the appropriate prefix to indicate the total number of carbon atoms in the
        parent chain and use the suffix ``-yne'' to indicate the presence of a triple bond
\end{enum}
