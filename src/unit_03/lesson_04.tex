\lesson{Standard Enthalpy of Formation}
Denoted by $\Delta H^{\circ}_f$, this is the energy associated with the formation of one mole of a 
substance from its elements in their standard states. For instance, the standard formation of 
carbon dioxide
\[
    \ch{C_{(s)}}+\ch{O2_{(g)}}\to \ch{CO2_{(g)}}\quad\Delta H^{\circ}_f=-393.5\,\si{kJ/mol}
\]
\textbf{Note:} though the name does not include the word ``molar'', it is always a quantity of
energy measured in \textit{energy per mole}. That is, kJ/mol.
\begin{important}
    Since $\Delta H^{\circ}_f$ deals with the energy associated with the formation of a substance
    from its elements in standard states, the standard enthalpy of formation for ELEMENTS to be 0.
    For instance, $\ch{Fe_{(s)}}$, $\ch{O2_{(g)}}$, $\ch{H2_{(g)}}$, $\ch{Br2_{(\ell)}}$, etc.
    all have $\Delta H^{\circ}_f=0$.
\end{important}

\begin{sample}{Write the formation equation for liquid ethanol.}
    Liquid ethanol has chemical formula $\ch{C2H3OH_{(\ell)}}$
    \[
        \ch{2C_{(s)}}+\ch{3H2_{(g)}}+\frac{1}{2}\ch{O2_{(g)}}\to \ch{C2H3OH_{(\ell)}}
    \]
\end{sample}

\begin{sample}{Write the formation equation for liquid carbon acid.}
    Liquid carbon acid has chemical formula $\ch{H2CO3_{(\ell)}}$
    \[
        \ch{C_{(s)}}+\ch{H2_{(g)}}+\frac{3}{2}\ch{O_{(\ell)}}\to \ch{H2CO3_{(\ell)}}
    \]
\end{sample}

Hess's Law is also applied to the standard enthalpy of formation
\[
    \Delta H^{\circ}_f=\Sigma\Delta H^{\circ}_f\text{ products}-\Sigma\Delta H^{\circ}_f\text{ reactants}
\]
